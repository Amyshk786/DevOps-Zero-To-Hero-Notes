2) Why DevOps ?

There is a Developer and this developer is trying to write the Code for his Application. 

End Goal for the Developer or the Organisation is Delivering the Application to the Customer who will be Using this Application. 


Problem - Before 10 years Jab DevOps nhi tha Toh Tab developers Code likhte thee and Usko Ek Central Location Per Rakhte thee aur Ek Dusre Ke Sath Share krte thee Application ka Code and Check Karte thee. [SVN & CVS were the Centralized Repo Like GITHUB]

From This Central Location Sys-Admin used to create a Server and Deploy this Application which was Written By the Developer on The Server. 

And The Tester will Test this Application which is Deployed by the Sys-Admin on The Server. 

Once The Tester Has Tested this Application After that The Build & Release Engineer Will Promote the Application to the Next Level which Would be Staging Environment (Pre-Production) or Production Level. 

Once the Application is Well Tested in the Pre-Production Environment The Build & Release Engineer Will take Forward the Application to the Production Environment Where the End User or The Customer is there.



World of DevOps has Emerged or Evolved Because of this Very Own Reason That is Because Multiple People were Involved And All of this is a Manual Effort. So whenever there is a Manual Effort your process will be slow. So to Automate this Entire Process the World of DevOps has Emerged.

The Sys-Admin, Build & Release Engineer and Server Admin were Working Closely or Working Togehther to Deliver Your Application from your Personal Laptop onto your Production for Your Customer. Because Everything was Manual & Different Teams were Collabarating The Process was taking more time But the Entire Communication or the Entire System was not Effective. 




Solution - So Now to Improve this Process Everybody has Moved to a Concept called DevOps. To Improve the Process of Delivery By Adopting to the Automation, By Ensuring that there is a Quality in your Application, By Ensuring that you are Continuously Monitoring and Finally you have to Continuously Test Your Application. By Involving all these things you Improve the Effeciency of your Organisation and that is the Role of DevOps.

3) How to Introduce Yourself as a DevOps Engineer ? 


I am Working as a DevOps Engineer from past 6 Years and before that I was working as a Sys-Admin. In my Current Organisation I take care of Automation, I Ensure that there is a Quality that I am maintaining for the Application, I Ensure that I have set of Continuous Monitoring and I have Automated the Testing Process into the DevOps Lifecycle. For CI/CD I am using GitHub Actions, For the Deployment of Application onto Container Orchestration I am using Kubernetes, I am Doing Configuration Management using Ansible, I am Doing Infrastructure Automation Using Terraform.
