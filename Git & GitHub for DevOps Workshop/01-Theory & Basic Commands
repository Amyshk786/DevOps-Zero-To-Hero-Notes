Git & GitHub for DevOps Workshop
====================================

1) What is Git ?

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) used to track, manage, and maintain source code. It allows developers to:

- Maintain complete version history of projects

- Share code securely with team members

- Work simultaneously without conflicts

- Create branches for new features and bug fixes

- Merge changes efficiently

- Roll back to previous versions when needed






2) What is GitHub, GitLab & Bitbucket ?

GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are Source Code Management (SCM) platforms that use Git as their underlying version control technology. They provide powerful features that help teams:

- Create and manage repositories

- Track and control code versions

- Collaborate with team members efficiently

- Review code using pull/merge requests

- Maintain code history and audit trails

- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for automation

- Manage access control and permissions




================================

git init

git status

git add

git commit

git push

git restore

git diff

git reset --hard 'commit_id'

git logs





================================

When the File or Code is in File-System it is in "Un-Tracked" Status

When we do "git add <file_name>" the Code is in "Staged" Status

When we do "git commit -m 'commit_message'" the Code is in "Tracked" Status






================================

If we want to Push the Code from Git to GitHub we will follow below mentioned steps:

- git remote add origin "github_url" 

- git branch -M main

- git push -u origin main


# If we want to change the url of the Origin then we can use the below Command

- git remote set-url "https://PAT@github.com/REPO_NAME"






================================

We can Either Fork the GitHub Repository  [Fork Happens GitHub To GitHub]

OR

We Can Clone the GitHub Repository  [Clone Happens GitHub To Local]
