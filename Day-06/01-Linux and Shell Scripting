Day-06 - Linux and Shell Scripting 
======================================




1) What is a Operating System - Lets Say you have a Laptop and it has Key Components are Hardware, CPU, RAM, SSD/HDD & I/O You Use Some Kind Of Software on top of your Hardware like Jenkins, Operating System is Something that Acts as a Bridge Between Your Software and Hardware, So It Drives as a Medium for the Communication Between Your Software and Hardware.



2) Why Linux - Linux is a Free Operating System, OpenSource, It is Very Simple and Secure, It Contains Lot's of Distributions like Ubuntu, Centos, RedHat, Fedora, Apline Debian and Finally It is Very Fast.


- Free
- OpenSource
- Secure and Simple
- Distributions
- Fast



3) Linux Architecture - Heart of Linux OS is Kernel, On Top of the Kernel We Have System Libraries, On top of this we have Compilers, User Processors and System Related Softwares.



3A) What is a Kernel - Kernel is Heart of your Linux OS Why Because The Responsibility of Kernel is to Establish a Communication Between Your Hardware & Your Software. For Eg. There is a User and He Is Installing an Application Which is a Software and then there is a Hardware CPU, RAM, I/O, So OS is Responsible for Cascading your Request from Software to Hardware And the Kernel Takes the Responsibility for Cascading this Information and that is why Kernel is the called The Heart of your OS.




The Primary Responsibility of the Kernel are Listed Below -    

1) Firstly It is the Heart of Any OS

2) Device Management

3) Memory Management

4) Process Management

5) It is Responsible for Handling the System Related Calls.



3B) System Libraries - System Librarie Are Basically Responsible for Performing a Task, If a User is Trying to Perform a Task So It comes from System Libraries and then it Goes to the Kernel. Each OS has their Own System Libraries but the Concept is the Same.



3C) Compilers - If you want to Run Java, Python or Any other Programming Language So Your OS has to Compile this Code and For That Reason we have Compilers, User Processors and System Related Softwares.

# Overview of Linux Architecture
==================================


Linux follows a modular architecture, which consists of:
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Hardware – The physical components (CPU, RAM, Storage, Network, etc.).


2. Kernel – The core of the Linux OS that manages hardware and system resources.


3. System Libraries – Interfaces that allow user applications to communicate with the kernel.


4. Shell – A command-line interpreter that takes user inputs and passes them to the kernel.


5. User Applications – Software programs that run on the operating system.

Fundamentals of Shell Scripting -
=====================================


Login to Your VM    ->     sudo apt update



free -h  -> to see the Memory Usage


nproc  -> To see Number of CPUs VM Has


df -h  -> What is the Disk Filesystem Size


top  -> We can get the Complete Information Memory, CPU, Disk
