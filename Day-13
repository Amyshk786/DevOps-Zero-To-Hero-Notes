Storage classes (Standard, Infrequent Access, Glacier) for cost-efficient storage.

Versioning, lifecycle management, and cross-region replication.

S3 encryption and access controls (IAM policies, bucket policies).

Event notifications and integration with Lambda for serverless data processing.


Why Important: S3 is a foundational service for storing backups, log files, application data, and more.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


5) IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Purpose: IAM allows secure management of access to AWS services and resources.

Key Features:

Fine-grained permissions using policies for users, groups, and roles.

Role-based access control (RBAC) for services, applications, and users.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.


Why Important: IAM is critical for securing access to AWS resources and adhering to least-privilege best practices.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


6) CloudWatch

Purpose: CloudWatch monitors AWS resources and applications, providing logs, metrics, and alerts.

Key Features:

Custom dashboards for resource monitoring.

Alarms for thresholds on metrics (CPU usage, disk IO, etc.).

Logs aggregation for troubleshooting and analysis.

CloudWatch Events for automating responses to system changes.


Why Important: Essential for monitoring system health, performance, and automating responses to events.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


7) Lambda

Purpose: AWS Lambda enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, utilizing a serverless architecture.

Key Features:

Event-driven execution based on triggers (e.g., S3 file upload, API Gateway request).

Scalability, as Lambda automatically scales the application by running code in response to each event.

Integration with other AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.


Why Important: Reduces operational overhead by eliminating the need to manage infrastructure for specific workloads.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


8) AWS Cloud Build Services

AWS CodeBuild: A fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable software packages.

AWS CodePipeline: A continuous delivery service that automates the release pipeline for fast, reliable updates.

AWS CodeDeploy: A service for automating code deployments to any instance (EC2, Lambda, on-premises servers).

Why Important: These services are critical for DevOps workflows, enabling CI/CD pipelines to streamline code integration and deployment.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


9) AWS Config

Purpose: AWS Config tracks AWS resource configurations and changes, enabling compliance auditing and security analysis.

Key Features:

Configuration history and tracking of changes across resources.

Compliance checking against desired configurations (e.g., specific security groups, VPC settings).

Notifications for configuration changes and integration with AWS Lambda for automatic remediation.


Why Important: It ensures compliance, governance, and security best practices by auditing configuration changes.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


10) Billing and Cost Management

Purpose: Tools for tracking, monitoring, and optimizing AWS costs and usage.

Key Features:

Cost Explorer for tracking spending and identifying trends.

Budgets and alerts to manage costs proactively.

Detailed usage reports for optimizing resources and cutting costs.


Why Important: Managing cloud costs is crucial for optimizing resource usage and staying within budget.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


11) AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

Purpose: AWS KMS helps manage encryption keys securely and enables data encryption for various AWS services.

Key Features:

Centralized key management and policies.

Automatic integration with services like EBS, S3, RDS, and Lambda for encryption at rest.

Auditing and tracking of key usage with CloudTrail.


Why Important: KMS helps secure sensitive data through encryption, ensuring compliance with security policies.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


12) CloudTrail

Purpose: CloudTrail records AWS API calls for governance, compliance, and auditing.

Key Features:

Logs every action made by users, roles, or AWS services.

Integration with CloudWatch for real-time monitoring of API activity.

Trail creation for continuous monitoring and automated compliance checking.


Why Important: CloudTrail is essential for tracking user actions and maintaining security by providing a full audit trail of all changes in the AWS environment.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


13) AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Purpose: EKS is a managed service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without managing the Kubernetes control plane.

Key Features:

Automated scaling and updates of Kubernetes clusters.

Secure and fully managed Kubernetes environment with integrated IAM and VPC.

Integration with Fargate for serverless Kubernetes.


Why Important: EKS simplifies Kubernetes operations, making it easier to run and scale containerized applications in AWS.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


14) Fargate & ECS (Elastic Container Service)

Purpose: ECS is a container orchestration service, and Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that removes the need to manage infrastructure.

Key Features:

Fargate: Run containers without managing EC2 instances.

Integration with EKS for Kubernetes support.


Why Important: These services allow DevOps teams to deploy, manage, and scale containers without managing the underlying infrastructure.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


15) ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Purpose: The ELK Stack provides real-time search, analysis, and visualization of log data.

Key Features:

Elasticsearch: Full-text search and analytics.
