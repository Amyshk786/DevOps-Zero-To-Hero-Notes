DevOps Day 2 - Software Development Lifecycle [SDLC] 
=====================================================



Software Deployment Life Cycle (SDLC) - Software Deployment Life Cycle (SDLC) is a Process Used by the Software Industry whether it is a Process or Whether it is a Culture, It is a Set of Standards that is followed in the Software Industry to Design Develop and to Test. And the End Goal is to Deliver a High Quality Product. 





Software Development Life Cycle is a Process that is followed by the Industry to Design Develop and Test High Quality Product.


We are working in a Org named Example.com At this org we develop Ecommerce Applications. In the org there are different phases like Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, Deployment. The org has decided to Have a Kids Section as they do not have that section, So they have decided to Launch a Kids Catalog. The Sr Members gets Inputs and Feedback from the customers in which age group they are interested in it, Will Kids Catalog be Useful for them & If Nobody is interested in it so we can suspend the idea at this stage.


1) Planning Phase - In the Planning Phase we have to Gather the Requirements. In this Stage we will gather Feedback and Inputs from Customers if they are Interested in Kids Catalog or not and If they are Interested than in which age group they are interested from age 1-4 or in age group 6-12. Once we have this Collective Information that Phase is Called as Planning and Requirement Phase. (Business Analyst & Product Owner)


2) Defining Phase - Once we are done with the Planning Phase Then we can Start with the Defining Phase. In terms of Defining Requirements you Clearly Define the Requirements in terms of Documents. In terms of Documents you have to Write that I have done Customer Research and on My Customer Research I understood that 6-12 years only Four Customers are Interested & 1-4 years Sixteen Customers are Interested. Now they will write a Document called as Software Requirement Speicification Document In this document they will provide all the Data which they have Collected as Part of Planning Phase.


3) Designing Phase - After that we will move to the Designing Phase So Designing Phase is very Critical Phase Because in Designing Phase you will do High Level Design (HLD) and Low Level Design (LLD). Lets say we have a Architect or Team Leader these members will write the HLD on the HLD you will be Talking about the Overall Your System has to be Scalable or Whenever there is a Requirement This Kids Catalog have to be Scalable to Probably there might be more Load for the Kids Catalog during Christmas. So you have to Build your Kids Catalog Application in such a way that it is Scalable when Required or it is Highly Available. These things we will Design in HLD. Number of Replicas and Which Database will be used are also decided in HLD.  And Coming to the LLD your Architect and the Development Team they would write the LLD Requirements. Like Lets use These Particular Functions or Modules They also decide which Programming Language will be used like  Java, Python.


4) Building Phase - In this case Building is Nothing but Developing So Once your Sr members of the Team have come up with the Low Level Design and High Level Design and your Product Owner and Business Analyst have come up with the Planning Requirements & Software Requirement Speicification Documents The Next step is to Develop the Application as all the Stories are Created and All Documents have been Written Now we have to move to the Next Stage that is Developing. All the things are done we have spoke to the Customers you got all the Requirements Your Design Documents are Ready So now it Comes to the Developer and these Developers will Start writing the Application Code in their Favorite Language or The Language that is used within your Organisation. So This Phase is Called as Developing Phase, In this Phase the Developers will Read the Jira items he will read the Documents that are prepared and he will start writing the Code. Once he writes the Code he will push this to a Common Location in the Organisation Most of the organisations these days use Git (It is a Source Code Repository) We need a Source Code Repository because there are Multiple Developers in the Organisation and they have to share this code with other members in the team and that is the Reason organisations use a Centralised Repository or Distributed Repository. So now the Developers wrote the Code he got it reviewed by the Peer Members and finally he pushed the Code to the Git. This Phase is Called as Developing Phase. [This Phase is Primarily for Developers]


5) Testing Phase - So the Developers said that the application is working fine on my Server as we want to Deliver a High Quality Product, Prompt and a High Quality code to the Customer That is the reason we Test the Application in the Testing Phase. In Testing phase This Application that is Stored in the Git Repository that is taken and Deployed in a Server and Then you have a team in the Organisation that is Called Quality Assurance Engineer (QE) team. These Engineers basically take care of Testing the Software. [Developers have Build the Software and the QE team has Tested the Software]  [This Phase is Primarily for QE Engineers]



6) Deployment Phase - In the Deployment Phase you Basically Promote this Application to the Production and Our Customer will be Receiving this Application or Software in the Production Stage.





--> DevOps Comes into the Picture for Improving the Organisations Efficiency. In the Building Phase Developer has written the Code and finally he has pushed that code in the Centralised Repository i.e Git Repository. In the Testing Phase Testers are Testing the Code and In the Deployment Phase we have Moved the Application to the Production. [So DevOps Engineers Basically Fastens this Process, He Improves the Process to Deliver the Code Quickly and By Ensuring all of these (Building, Testing & Deployment) Terms are Matched. A DevOps Engineer Ensures that the Building, Testing and Deployment Processes are Followed Without Any Manual Intervention that is Everything Happens in a Automated Way with Efficiency] 





--> All this Processes can be done in different ways like Waterfall Models, Agile Models, Iterative Model. Every Orgainsations these Days are using Agile Methodology. In Agile Methodology you follow all of these phases but you do it Agile like you take Short Sprints that is you don't wait till all of your Planning is done, you don't wait till all of your Defining is done, Or Design Documents are Done. Once a Small Chunk of it is Done you start with all of these Process and then the Other Chunk is done then you again follow this entire Circut. That is called Agile.
