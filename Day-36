Day-36 | KUBERNETES INTERVIEW QUESTIONS PART-1| What's Your Score ? |10/10
============================================================================




Q1 - What is the Difference Between Docker and Kubernetes?


A1 - Docker is a Container Platform Where as Kubernetes is a  Container Orchestration Platform that Offers Capabilities like Auto Scaling, Auto Healing, Clustering and Enterprise Level Support like Load Balancing.





------------------------------------------------------------


Q2 - What are the Main Components of Kubernetes Architecture?



A2 - On a Broad Level I can divide the Kubernetes Components in two part:


- Control Plane  -> API Server, Scheduler, ETCD, Controller Manager & Cloud Controller Manager


- Data Plane  -> Kube-Proxy, Kubelet & Container Runtime





------------------------------------------------------------


Q3 - What are the Main Difference Between Dock Swarm and Kubernetes?



A3 - Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are Essential Components of Container Orchestration that improve the deployment of the application. Google created the kubernetes, so it comes up with Strong Community Support, Automated Setups, Advance Networking, CNCF Community Support and Scalability. Kubernetes is Suited for Mid-Size and Large Orgainsations

Docker Swarm is a Native Docker Platform Tool that enhances the User-Friendly Operations and easy of Usability. Whereas Docker Swarm is used by Small Orgainsations and for Simple Applications






------------------------------------------------------------



Q4 - What is the Difference Between Docker Container and Kubernetes Pod?



A4 - A Pod in Kubernetes is a Runtime Speicification of a Container in Docker. A Pod provides more Declarative Way of defining using YAML and you can Run more than One Container in a Pod.





------------------------------------------------------------



Q5 - What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?



A5 - In Kubernetes Namespace is a Logical Isolation of Resources, Network Policies, RBAC & Everything. For Example There are 2 Pojects Using Same K8s Cluster. 1-Cluster Can Use Namespace-1 and the Other Project Can Use Namespace-2 Without Any Overlap and Authentication Problem. 






------------------------------------------------------------



Q6 - What is the Role of Kube-Proxy?



A6 - Kube-proxy works by maintaining a set of network rules on each node in the cluster, which are updated dynamically as services are added or removed. When a client sends a request to a service, the request is intercepted by kube-proxy on the node where it was received. Kube-proxy then looks up the destination endpoint for the service and routes the request accordingly. 

Kube-Proxy is an Essential Component of a Kubernetes Cluster as it Ensures that Services Can Communicate with Eachother.





------------------------------------------------------------



Q7 - What Are the Different Types of Services in Kubernetes?



A7 - There are 3 Different Types of Service that a User Can Create

- Cluster IP Mode

- Node Port Mode 

- Load Balancer Mode 



------------------------------------------------------------



Q8 - What is the Difference Between Node Port & Load Balancer Type Service



A8 - When a service is created a NodePort type, The kube-proxy updates the IPTables with Node IP address and port that is chosen in the service configuration to access the pods.

Where as if you create a Service as type Load Balancer, the Cloud Control Manager creates a External Load Balancer IP using the Underlying Cloud Provider logic in the C-CM.

Users can Access Services using the External IP






------------------------------------------------------------


Q9 - What is the Role of Kubelet?


A9 - Kubelet manages the containers that are scheduled to run on that node. It ensures that the containers are running and healthy, and that the resources they need are available.

Kubelet communicates with the Kubernetes API server to get information about the containers that should be running on the node, and then starts and stops the containers as needed to maintain the desired state. It also monitors the containers to ensure that they are running correctly, and restarts them if necessary.






------------------------------------------------------------



Q10 - What are your Day to Day Activities on Kubernetes?



A10 - As  part of the devops engineer role we manage kubernetes clusters for our organization and we also ensure that the applications are deployed onto 
the kubernetes cluster and there are no issues with the application so we have set up monitoring on our kubernetes cluster we ensure that whenever there are bugs on the kubernetes cluster for example the developers are not able to troubleshoot some issue with respect to pods developers are not able to troubleshoot with respect to Services they are not able to route the traffic in inside the kubernetes cluster so in such cases as Subject Matter Expertise On the Kubernetes Cluster We Step Up and Solve their problems. Apart from that we Also do A lot of Maintainence Activities Like we have a K8s Cluster with 3-Master and 10-Worker Nodes. So we have to do do some continuous maintenance activities on this worker nodes probably upgrading the versions of his worker nodes or installing some default mandatory packages ensuring that these worker nodes are not Exposed to security Vulnerabilities. So All of these things are our Day to Day Activities on Kubernetes A part from that We Also Serve as a Subject Matter Expertise On the Kubernetes So If anyone in the Organization has any Issues with K8s they Create a Jira Tickets for Us and we will help them in Solving or Making them Understand the Concept of K8s.
