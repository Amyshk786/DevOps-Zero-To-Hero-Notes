Day-09 & Day-11 - Git and GitHub
===================================


What is Version Controlling or Version Control System - The primary Concept of VCS is 2 Things,  It Addresses 2 Major Problems.

1) Sharing Of Code 

2) Versioning





What is Fork -  Fork is Used to Create Entire Copy of Original Source Code Repository 

What is Clone  -  Git Clone is a Process Using Which You Pull The Code from GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket And download Specific Repository




SVN & CVS Both were Centralised Version Control System

Git is a distributed version control system commonly used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Below are some of the essential Git commands and their detailed usage:

Git vs GitHub
================




# Git is a Distributed Version Control System & It is OpenSource




# GitHub and Other Orgainsations Like  GitLab and Bitbucket have built better Solutions in terms of Usability, in terms of Raising Issues, Commenting, Talking to Peers, Reviewing the Code and Now a Days GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket Also Supports Project Management. Fundamentally GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are using the same concept of improvising the existing Git. And all of the Orgainsations have built a wrapper or they have built a solution on top of Git.

Git Workflow - 
==============


1. A DEVELOP branch is created from MAIN


2. A RELEASE branch is created from DEVELOP


3. FEATURE branches are created from DEVELOP


4. When a FEATURE is complete it is merged into the DEVELOP branch


5. When the RELEASE branch is done it is merged into DEVELOP and MAIN


6. If an issue in MAIN is detected a HOTFIX branch is created from MAIN


7. Once the HOTFIX is complete it is merged to both DEVELOP and MAIN
