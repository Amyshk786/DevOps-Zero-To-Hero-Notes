# Docker Networking

Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the host system. Containers run isolated from the host system and need a way to communicate with each other and with the host system.

By default, Docker provides two network drivers for you, the "Bridge" & the "Overlay Drivers." 

```
docker network ls
```

```
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
xxxxxxxxxxxx        none                null
xxxxxxxxxxxx        host                host
xxxxxxxxxxxx        bridge              bridge
```





--------------------------------------------------- 




### Bridge Networking
=========================

The default network mode in Docker. It creates a private network between the host and containers, allowing containers to communicate with each other and with the host system.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/217745543-f40e5614-ac34-4b78-85a9-91b24512388d.png)





If you want to secure your containers and isolate them from the default bridge network you can also create your own bridge network.

```
docker network create -d bridge my_bridge
```

Now, if you list the docker networks, you will see a new network.

```
docker network ls

NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
xxxxxxxxxxxx        bridge              bridge
xxxxxxxxxxxx        my_bridge           bridge
xxxxxxxxxxxx        none                null
xxxxxxxxxxxx        host                host
```





This new network can be attached to the containers, when you run these containers.

```
docker run -d --net=my_bridge --name db training/postgres
```




This way, you can run multiple containers on a single host platform where one container is attached to the default network and 
the other is attached to the my_bridge network.

These containers are completely isolated with their private networks and cannot talk to each other.

However, you can at any point of time, attach the first container to my_bridge network and enable communication

```
docker network connect my_bridge web
```

--------------------------------------------------- 





### Host Networking
=====================

This mode allows containers to share the host system's network stack, providing direct access to the host system's network.

To attach a host network to a Docker container, you can use the --network="host" option when running a docker run command. When you use this option, the container has access to the host's network stack, and shares the host's network namespace. This means that the container will use the same IP address and network configuration as the host.



Here's an example of how to run a Docker container with the host network:

```
docker run --network="host" <image_name> <command>
```




Keep in mind that when you use the host network, the container is less isolated from the host system, and has access to all of the host's network resources. This can be a security risk, so use the host network with caution.



Additionally, not all Docker image and command combinations are compatible with the host network, so it's important to check the image documentation or run the image with the --network="bridge" option (the default network mode) first to see if there are any compatibility issues.





--------------------------------------------------- 




### Overlay Networking
=========================

This mode enables communication between containers across multiple Docker host machines, allowing containers to be connected to a single network even when they are running on different hosts.





--------------------------------------------------- 





### Macvlan Networking
=========================

This mode allows a container to appear on the network as a physical host rather than as a container.

# Practical for Bridge Networking


# Login Container


cd Docker-Zero-to-Hero   -> cd examples/first-docker-file/




# We Have Created a Container with the Name Login 
docker run -d --name login nginx:latest





# We Have Logged into the Login Container 
docker exec -it login /bin/bash


apt update 


apt-get install iputils-ping -y   [We have Installed Ping ]


ping -V


docker ps

                }
            }
        }
    }
]



Note - The IP For the Login Container is "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3"  & the Network Type is Default Bridge



ping 172.17.0.4


Output = ping 172.17.0.4

IMP Note - As Both Login and Logout Containers are on the Same Bridge Network which is the veth0 or docker0 that is why if we do Ping from Login to Logout it will Happen and Same From Logout to Login It will Happen.
